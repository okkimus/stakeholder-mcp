# User stakeholders – gamified vocabulary game modes

**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Stakeholders:** Jordan (end-user, millennial), Margaret (end-user, senior)  
**Topic:** Desired gamified game modes for word memorisation

---

## Prompt

We're exploring new gamified game modes for vocabulary learning in our language app (vocabulary, quizzes, short stories). Users have asked for more interactive ways to memorise words. What kinds of game modes would you actually use? Think: quick sessions on the bus vs longer practice, competition vs solo, types of interactions (matching, typing, speaking, swiping), and what would make you come back daily. Be specific about 2–3 ideas you'd love and one you'd skip.

## Jordan (28, urban professional)

**Game modes they would use:**

1. **Rapid-Swipe Game: Word Flick**
   - Swipe left = "Don't Know", right = "Know". Streak counter, badges/points for daily streaks.
   - Quick, good for short sessions; streaks encourage daily use.

2. **Competitive Mode: Speed Quiz Showdown**
   - Timed quizzes, points for correct answers, weekly leaderboards, challenges, compete with friends.
   - Competition and social motivation to practice daily.

3. **Creative Mode: Word Chain Reaction**
   - Build words where the next word starts with the last letter of the previous (e.g. CAT → TIGER → RABBIT). Solo and multiplayer.
   - Mix of creativity and competition.

**Skip:** Escape Room Challenge – too long and complex for quick sessions; more puzzle than word learning.

## Margaret (67, retired teacher)

**Game modes they would use:**

1. **Word Match**
   - Match words with meanings, synonyms, or translations (cards, tiles, or drag-and-drop). Large text, progress tracker, optional hints, calm and non-competitive.
   - Simple, clear, good for short sessions.

2. **Word Chain**
   - Solo: think of a word starting with the last letter of the previous word. Clear display, Hint button, "Learn More" for meaning/usage, option to save words for review.
   - Thoughtful, low-pressure way to expand vocabulary.

3. **Flashcard Frenzy**
   - Flashcard-style: see word, type translation/definition. Speed can increase with correct answers for gentle challenge.
   - (Response truncated; assumed: good for paced recall practice.)

**Priorities:** Clarity, large readable text, simple navigation, helpful error messages, optional hints, calm/solo options.

## Summary (for downstream discussions)

- **Common themes:** Quick sessions, clear UI, streaks/progress, optional hints, solo + optional social/competitive.
- **Candidate features:** Word Flick (swipe), Speed Quiz Showdown (timed + leaderboards), Word Chain (solo/multiplayer), Word Match (match words to meanings), Flashcard Frenzy (timed recall).
- **Avoid (or deprioritise):** Long, puzzle-heavy modes (e.g. escape room) for “quick memorisation” use case.
