## Marcus Rivera – Design considerations

### General

- **Consistency:** Same layout principles, colour scheme, typography; central dashboard/menu for modes; similar navigation patterns so it doesn’t feel samey.
- **Accessibility:** Large, high-contrast text; touch targets ≥ 44×44 px; screen reader support and clear audio feedback.
- **Onboarding:** Short, engaging tutorial per mode; visual cues and simple instructions.
- **Feedback:** Immediate, clear visual and audio feedback for correct/incorrect; gentle, encouraging copy on errors.

### Per mode

1. **Word Flick**
   - Layout: Full-screen, word centred; swipe indicators or subtle animation.
   - Touch: Large swipe area for different finger sizes.
   - Feedback: Green tick (Know) / red cross (Don’t Know); subtle haptic.
   - Streaks/badges: Sidebar or top banner, non-intrusive.

2. **Speed Quiz Showdown**
   - Layout: Timer prominent at top; questions and options clearly laid out.
   - Touch: Large, well-spaced answer buttons.
   - Feedback: Live score; leaderboard visible from game or dedicated tab, clear ranking/progress.

3. **Word Chain**
   - Layout: Clearly different solo vs multiplayer.
   - Touch: Large buttons for submit and hints.
   - Feedback: Correct/incorrect and chain progress.
   - Hints / Learn more: One tap, no flow break; competitive mode: optional chat/notifications.

4. **Word Match**
   - Layout: Grid, large readable cards; enough spacing; drag-and-drop or tap-to-match.
   - Touch: Large, easy-to-drag cards; clear instructions.
   - Feedback: Positive reinforcement (animation/sound) on correct match; clear hint button.

5. **Flashcard Frenzy**
   - Layout: Single word prominent; large text field for answer.
   - Touch: Large keyboard/typing area.
   - Feedback: Immediate correctness; encouraging messages on mistakes.
   - Speed: Gradual increase, with option to adjust or pause for users who need more time.

### Additional

- **Quick sessions:** Start/complete in short bursts; clear save/continue.
- **Controls:** Familiar gestures across modes (e.g. swipe for nav, tap for selection).
- **Aesthetics:** Playful but professional; vibrant colours and light animation to support gamification.
